            <p>
                When a biomentric authentication startup has spent 6 years in R&D and is finally ready to hit the market, a lot of things need to be in place. I was brought in to solve internal bottlenecks and create a scalable onboarding platform.

            <p>

            <h2>3. Redesigning the bill for a big 6 energy company</h2>
            <p>

                When an energy company loses 60,000 customers a month, gets 4000 customer support calls each day, costing Â£200,000 per month, it's worth taking a look at how design can help retain and inform customers, and cut costs.
