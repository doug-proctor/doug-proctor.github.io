                    When a biomentric authentication startup has spent 6 years in R&D and is finally ready to hit the market, a lot of things need to be in place. I was brought in to solve internal bottlenecks and create a scalable onboarding platform.

                    When a team of 8 designers work remotely with 4 scrum teams of architects, engineers and QA hawks and analysts, there needs to be control, visibility and predictability.
