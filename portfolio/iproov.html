        <h1>Who are iProov?</h1>
        <p>iProov is a B2B online biometric authentication service whereby users can authenticate themselves on various online services using only their face and an email address. It has significant applications in KYC for banks and government departments, including border control.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-was-i-doing-at-iproov">
        <h1>What was I doing at iProov?</h1>
        <p>
            After 7 years of research and development, iProov was ready to hit the market. While the sales team where were working overtime to land those crucial first few Big Bank contracts in the UK, Europe and the US, I was brought in to create a second, much more scalable route to market, which we would later call the Reseller Portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to a limited budget, and that I have experience in other areas than design, I had a hybrid role:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project lead / PO</li>
            <li>UX research and design</li>
            <li>UI design</li>
            <li>React/Redux developer</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            üí°
            During this project working as a UX/UI/Front-end ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù, I discovered that the question of unicorns should not be ‚Äúwill I ever find a unicorn?‚Äù, but instead ‚Äúis it even a good idea?‚Äù. Depending on the circumstances, there can be very problematic conflicts of interest.
        </div>
        <p>
            iProov is very much a research and engineering-led company. I was their first designer, and it was my first time working as the only designer in a company. This brought new challenges for both, and I made it my mission to demonstrate to them the importance of design, especially at this crucial stage in their journey of going to market.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="my-goals">
        <h1>My goals</h1>
        <p>
            iProov had two main problems that I was going to be working on:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                iProov was doing everything manually. Almost all interactions with potential customers happened over the phone or by email, with manual data entry to the CRM, manual API credential generation, manual supply of documentation, and so on. It was inevitable that once the number of leads reached a certain point, some of them began to slip through the net and were lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                iProov was already about to land their first significant customers: large organisations - banks and governmental departments - that took months of negotiation to land. But iProov needed an additional, much faster, more automated way to bring in much larger numbers of smaller companies, and if they didn‚Äôt have the right scalable infrastructure in place when the time came, they knew that they‚Äôd fall behind the competition.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            From these two problems followed my own two primary design goals (which were really both sides of the same coin):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Specify, design and create proofs-of-concept for new internal iProov <strong>business support systems</strong> that would be able to scale in the face of imminent rapid growth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design and manage the delivery of a <strong>customer onboarding and self-service portal</strong> that could also scale rapidly, whilst minimising the loss of customers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>KPIs</h2>

        <p>
            Whilst we could have come up with several KPIs to monitor, such as ‚Äúnumber of customers lost due to an email not being replied to‚Äù, we felt it wasn‚Äôt necessary because at this early stage there were such obvious low hanging fruit to pluck. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Automatically generating API credentials for customers instead of someone having to take time to do it manually ‚Äî huge win.
            </li>
            <li>
                Having a centralised record of which customers have signed which NDAs, and being able to follow up with one click ‚Äî huge win.
            </li>
            <li>Having all incoming support tickets automatically assigned to agents and SLAs with reminders in the Slack channel ‚Äî huge win</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With the autonomy I was given, and with the possibility of so many ‚Äúhuge win‚Äù low hanging fruits, this was the juiciest project I‚Äôve ever worked on.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section id="key-challenge-1">
        <h1>Key challenge: No customers to speak to</h1>

        <p>
            This project had one rather unsettling peculiarity that I‚Äôd never encountered before: we didn‚Äôt yet know who our customers were. While I was able to test prototypes for usability flaws using participants who approximated our target audience, initially there were many deeper hypotheses that I could not test in the ways that I usually could.
        </p>

        <h2>Answer</h2>

        <p>
            In lieu of minimising risk by speaking to customers, I took several decisions that aimed to minimise risk in other ways. They were:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Reusable design component system.</strong> Everything that rendered on the screen to make up a module, layout or customer journey belonged to a library of reusable design components. At first they were based heavily on Bootstrap 4 components, but as the project progress and our own specific component requirements emerged, I modified the Bootstrap components and build new ones.
                <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    üí°
                    My long-term vision for the component library was fully coded-up and documented ‚Äúkitchen sink‚Äù of iProov components that would be shared across all of their digital properties, from their corporate websites and sales tools to their emails. This consistency would reduce costs and strengthen the brand experience.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimise UI effort.</strong> By designing and building with the ‚Äúopinionated‚Äù Bootstrap 4 CSS framework we were able to get our interfaces up and running with minimal code being written. Less code means less development time, less QA time, fewer bugs, less maintenance time, and less attachment to something that might have to be scrapped. I believed that given our limited design resources on the project, the product should begin to develop its own visual identity only once the core proposition had stabilised.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Separation of API and client.</strong> We made sure that the product knew as little about the business logic and server logic as possible. That way we could easily make changes in one domain with minimal impact on other domains. For example, at once stage we completely re-designed the registration process and were able to do that barely touching the backend code.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Later on when the product was released and we began to get traction, we were able to finally employ more research techniques using the new customers as participants, and to begin to truly bring the customers into the design process. As a result of this we made several significant design changes to the Portal, and those changes were relatively low-cost and quick to implement. Moreover, the built-in flexibility of the design system would give the Portal a much longer life-span.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            üí°
            Of course, these risk mitigating steps should apply to all projects, regardless of how well the hypotheses have been tested, because the improvements in efficiency translate directly into reduced costs of maintenance and further development.
        </div>

    </section>

    <section id="key-challenge-2">
        <h1>Key challenge: New territory for everyone</h1>
        <p>
            Whilst the overall high-level brief didn‚Äôt change during my 14 months, there were several times when new things were discovered that meant some change in direction. As I worked with the CEO, we clarified new requirements on a weekly basis, and a few times large swathes of unexplored territories opened up right before us. This was exciting, but it needed to be managed!
        </p>
        <h2>Answer</h2>
        <p>
            We used several tools and methods for organising and prioritising the roadmap:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Agile</strong> - the project borrowed a few ideas from Agile, including (a loose interpretation of) sprints, and epics, stories and tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>JIRA</strong> - creating a ticket for every idea, prioritised and grouped by epic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Good old-fashioned whiteboard roadmap. </strong>Not many people bother to log into JIRA to see what‚Äôs going on, but with our roadmap visible to everyone in the company we could stay in sync and also use it to facilitate discussion.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It took time to keep everything maintained and up to date, but it paid off because we enabled us to keep our perspective on the project. This was useful whenever an exciting new idea came up ‚Äî we were able to resist jumping on it when it wasn‚Äôt really the right time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="key-challenge-3">
        <h1>Key challenge: Security, technology, and engineering first</h1>
        <p>
            There was no hope of achieving my design goals at iProov if I didn‚Äôt take the time to understand the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Security principles and processes, including their implementation of <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html">ISO27001</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The architecture of their unique platform, from the machine learning models to the networking elements, the separation of various databases and processes, and the various client applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reasons for the current setup, and the roadmap for changes and additions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Answer</h2>

        <p>
            I asked a lot of questions, and sat in many, many discussions. The more I gained an understanding of the above, the more I was able to participate in technical discussions and identify opportunities for creating better and better user experiences both on the customer portal and within the company‚Äôs internal processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working inside an early-stage startup (i.e. with no legacy spaghetti mess for an infrastructure!) meant I had opportunities to push for technical changes in the core system that would unlock significant improvements to the user experience. Levering this, I was able to push for a simpler, more trustworthy and scalable onboarding process.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section id="my-approach">
        <h1>My approach and process</h1>

        <p>
            I took the following broad steps and in this order:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Discovery</li>
            <li>UX, interaction design and testing</li>
            <li>Technical Prototyping</li>
            <li>Frontend development</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1. Discovery</h2>

        <p>
            I held several deep-dive discovery sessions with the CEO and CTO, where we examined the two key problems together and then hammered together a vision for solving them.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="/assets/img/iproov/andrew.jpg" alt="Brainstorming with CEO Andrew Bud" class="img-fluid">
            <figcaption>
                Brainstorming with CEO Andrew Bud
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
             I then conducted individual stakeholder interviews with the leadership team, the sales team and the technical managers. This gave me a good idea of what the pain-points were within each business function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Evaluation of the various 3rd party tools/services being used at iProov, as well as alternatives, especially with regard to their long-term compatibility with the vision. This involved a study of their API and developer documentation, as well as calls with the support team so that I could have my questions addressed.
        </p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Understanding of the shared strategic vision of the company, particularly with respect to the growth strategy.
            </li>
            <li>
                List of key internal bottlenecks within the company‚Äôs internal systems, especially the onboarding process.
            </li>
            <li>
                List of tools/services used, and their alternatives, along with their strengths and weaknesses.
            </li>
            <li>
                A set of hypotheses about how we could connect various tools and technologies together in a way that would 1) solve the bottlenecks and 2) allow new customers to onboard and service themselves with minimal reliance on iProov staff.
            </li>
            <li>
                A desire not to reinvent the wheel. Instead of spending months (or years) creating a 100% bespoke solution, it was clear that by carefully selecting and integrating various 3rd party services, we could create a solution much faster, and more cheaply.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2. UX & Interaction design and testing</h2>

        <p>
            This part of the design process focused on the customer-facing aspects of the project, in particular it would deal with onboarding, account set-up, self-provision of API access, access to documentation and to a new support ticket system. Basically, it would meet my second primary project goal. Methodologies included:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>User task modelling</li>
            <li>User journey flows / sketches</li>

        </p>

        <p>
            I created several rapid prototypes using PHP, Node.js and React. With each prototype I was able to test how well some of the 3rd party services would integrate with each other. I was especially interested in the flow of data, and the question of which platform should be the ‚Äòmaster‚Äô, and act as the ‚Äòsingle source of truth‚Äô. It emerged quite quickly that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust any 3rd party service to be the main data host, and we agreed that we would need to build that master repository ourselves.

        <h1>Results</h1>

        <p>
            When the MVP went live, it was incredibly satisfying to see all of our bottlenecks solved in one fell swoop. While there were many things to fix and improve (and there was a long roadmap that would take years to tackle), but as the iProov sales and technical teams began to use the new tool, we could see a sudden shift within the business towards more robust, more transparent processes that would be tracked and audited. Most importantly, the customer portal contained the details of every single potential customer, along with their onboarding progress.
        </p>

        <h2>Scalable onboarding</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of taking days of manual work to onboard new customers, suddenly we had customers onboarding themselves in minutes. Within the first month we had over 50 new customers who had successfully done a test integration of the iProov authentication service into their own systems. This rate of onboarding was actually too fast for iProov, who had to immediately put job adverts out in order to grow the sales and accounts team!
        </p>

        <h2>NDA tracking</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of manually emailing PDF attachments for customers to sign, iProov were now able to get customers to sign NDAs online as part of their registration process. Using the portal, iProov can see which customers haven‚Äôt signed and can send them a reminder with a single click. This saved hours of time each week and ensured that every single customer signed the NDA.
        </p>

        <h2>API credentials</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of the technical managers having to manually create API credentials in the system, customers could now simply generate them automatically using their portal account. This saved hours of time each week and ensured that every single customer was able to instantly access the iProov test service.
        </p>

        <h2>SLA technical support</h2>
        <p>
            By providing customers with an integrated ticketing system (via Freshdesk), we enabled a new support channel that:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Knew which SLA each customer was on and so could track iProov‚Äôs response, raising alarms when a ticket came close to breaching the SLA.
            </li>
            <li>
                Integrated into the company‚Äôs Slack account so that the support team had complete visibility without having to keep visiting the Freshdesk account
            </li>
        </ul>
