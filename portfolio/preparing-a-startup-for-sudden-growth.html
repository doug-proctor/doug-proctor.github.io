            <h1>Preparing a startup for sudden growth</h1>
            <p>
                When a biomentric authentication startup has spent 6 years in R&D and is finally ready to hit the market, a lot of things need to be in place.

    </p>
    <h2>The setup</h2>
    <p>
        After years of secret research and development, iProov was hitting the market. Unable to manually handle the influx of new customers, I was hired as an all-round UX, UI and engineer to come in and create an integrated and streamlined customer onboarding process.
    </p>
    <h2>Defining the problem</h2>
    <p>
        We worked together to establish a clearly articulated problem statement:
    </p>
    <div class="pull-quote">
        <span>
            How can we enable the company to support the sudden rapid growth in customer base?
        </span>
    </div>
    <p>
        Flip it on its head, break it down:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who are the customers?</li>
        <li>What are the current bottlenecks and pain points?</li>
        <li>How can we use technology to enable efffective self-service?</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>My approach</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        First, we had to understand the <strong>customers</strong> and different types of <strong>client relationships</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After many sessions with the leadership and sales team, I was able to uncover and document some clear answers.
    </p>
    <h3>Key tasks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Workshops with business, sales and technical teams</li>
        <li>Interviews with internal stakeholders and resellers</li>
    </ul>

</div>
    <div class="image-row">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <div class="image" style="background-image: url(/assets/img/iproov/1.png)"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <div class="image" style="background-image: url(/assets/img/iproov/2.png)"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <div class="image" style="background-image: url(/assets/img/iproov/3.png)"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
<div class="container">

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear and shared understanding of different possible client relationship structures</li>
        <li>A clear and shared understanding of how reporting and billing would work through a recursive reseller model</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead">
        Second, we had to understand the internal <strong>bottlenecks</strong> and <strong>pain points</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working with the sales and technical managers, I mapped out the entire onboarding process â€” from the legal paperwork, to deploying proof-of-concept service integrations, to billing and invoicing customers.

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A thorough mapping of the the original manual workflows, with their weak points identified</li>
        <li>A clearly documented proposal for solving the bottlenecks and pain points</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead">
        Then we had to understand how we could architect a scalable <strong>business support system</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The system needed to encompass the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pre-sales</li>
        <li>Sales</li>
        <li>Onboarding</li>
        <li>Technical support</li>
        <li>SLA reporting</li>
        <li>Billing and invoicing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key tasks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Workshops with business, sales and technical teams</li>
        <li>Reviewing API and developer documentation</li>
        <li>Calls with sales and support teams to get answers</li>
        <li>Creating rapid prototypes for service integrations as POCs</li>

    </div>
<div class="container">

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A shared vision of the customer-facing onboarding and self-service portal</li>
        <li>A common understanding of weâ€™d combine our own technology with 3rd party services to create scalable business workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="lead">
        And finally, we had to understand what the customer-facing <strong>onboarding platform</strong> would look like.
